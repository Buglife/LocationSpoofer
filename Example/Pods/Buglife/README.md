[Buglife](https://www.buglife.com) is an awesome bug reporting SDK & web platform for iOS apps. Here's how it works:

1. User takes a screenshot, or stops screen recording
2. User annotates their screenshot & writes feedback
3. Bug reports are pushed to your team's email/Jira/Slack/Asana/wherever you track bugs.

You can also find Buglife for Android [here](https://github.com/buglife/buglife-android).

## Demo

To try the example app, you can either run `pod try Buglife` from your command line, OR clone this repository and open the Xcode project under the “Example” directory.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

To integrate Buglife into your Xcode project using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org), specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Buglife'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

Place the following line in your Cartfile:

``` Swift
github "Buglife/Buglife-iOS"
```

Now run `carthage update`. Then drag & drop the Buglife.framework in the Carthage/build folder to your project. Refer to the [Carthage README](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) for detailed / updated instructions.

### Manually

1. [Download the Buglife SDK](https://www.buglife.com/download-ios-sdk)

2. Unzip it & pull `Buglife.framework` into the Frameworks group in your project. In the following dialog box, make sure you have "Copy items if needed" checked.

## Code

1. Import the Buglife framework header into your app delegate.

    ```swift
    // Swift
    import Buglife
    ```
    
    ```objective-c
    // Objective-C
    #import <Buglife/Buglife.h>
    ```

2. Add the following to your app delegate's `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method.
	
	```swift
	// Swift
	Buglife.shared().start(withEmail: "you@yourdomain.com")
	```
	```objective-c
	// Objective-C
	[[Buglife sharedBuglife] startWithEmail:@"you@yourdomain.com"];
	```
	Be sure to replace `you@yourdomain.com` with your own email address; this is where bug reports will be sent to.
	
## Usage

Build & run your app. Once your app is running, shake your device (\^⌘Z in the simulator) to report a bug! Bug reports are sent directly to your email address.

You can customize how the bug reporter is invoked. **Rather than shake, we recommend configuring the bug reporter to be shown when a user takes a screenshot:**

```swift
// Swift
Buglife.shared().invocationOptions = .screenshot
```
```objective-c
// Objective-C
[Buglife sharedBuglife].invocationOptions = LIFEInvocationOptionsScreenshot;
```

To learn more about customizing Buglife, refer to the [documentation](https://www.buglife.com/docs).
